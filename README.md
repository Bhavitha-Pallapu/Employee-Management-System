My project addresses a common challenge faced by organizations: manually managing employee records such as attendance, salary, leaves, and performance, which can be time-consuming and error-prone. The system allows administrators to register employees once, storing essential data such as name, age, email, job role, and salary using a user-friendly interface built with Java Swing. Managers can view, update, or delete employee details as needed, streamlining data maintenance and reducing paperwork. A centralized dashboard enables real-time access to employee records and allows salary calculations, improving operational efficiency. Additional features include leave management and easy generation of employee reports, making it easier for HR to monitor work patterns. The system ensures better organization, faster access to employee data, and improved accuracy in administrative tasks.
